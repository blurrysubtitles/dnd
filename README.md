# DnD++

This is my first project started with my own ideas. My first goal is to make a tool that works better for me than D&D Beyond for content. My pie in the sky is a group of applications and tools that make playing the game and exploring possibilities within the rules more convenient for DMs and players alike.


## To Do list
1) Code-first postgresql database
2) Web app for db interaction
3) Import content
