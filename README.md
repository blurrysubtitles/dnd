# DnD++

let's make it easier to keep track of dungeons and dragons source material.

maybe we'll make some tools to help dungeon masters and/or players!


## To Do list
1) make a code-first postgresql database (postgres server is already installed)
2) design a schema for "features"
  a) keep it general
  b) big ticket items: spells and class features
3) import some data and test some queries~
